## Project purpose

- Demonstrate proportionality analysis of a real microbiome dataset using `propr` package

- Evaluate precision and recall of the proportionality method (relative correlation) 

## Problem

Association analysis in microbiome studies infers relationship between
OTUs/ taxa. Pearson r Correlation and Spearman's Rank Correlation are
classical methods in association analysis. However, microbiome relative
data is compositional and consequently make the classical methods
inappropriate. If naively applying classical methods to compositional
microbiome data, we likely end up with getting spurious correlations.

## Solution 

The review article published in 2017, "Microbiome datasets are
compositional: and this is not optional" [@gloor2017]summarized four
newly-invented statistical methods dealing with compositionality and
achieving reliable association relationship. The four methods consists
of SparCC, Spiec Easi, proportionality (ϕ and ρ).

Proportionality is a precise indicator of absolute correlation, although
sensitivity is limited [@quinn2017].

## Scripts

```{r libaries, results='hide'}
library(tidyverse) 

library(devtools)
# install_github("tpq/propr")  
library(propr)

library(stringr)

```

### Step 1. Load dataset

The microbiome OTU table and metadata was retrieved from [ML
Repo](https://knights-lab.github.io/MLRepo/docs/turnbaugh_lean_obese_all.html)

```{r}

# raw OTU table
raw_otu <- read.csv(file = "https://knights-lab.github.io/MLRepo/datasets/turnbaugh/refseq/otutable.txt",
                    header=T,
                    sep = "")

```

The raw OTU table contains 557 features (OTUs) in 281 samples.

Shorten OTU identifiers with keeping only genus and species names, using
`stringr` package. And then accumulate counts of OTUs at the species
level.

```{r shorten OTU names}

head(raw_otu$X.OTU) 

# split strings 
otu.id <- raw_otu$X.OTU

split_otu.id <- str_split_fixed(otu.id, "_", n=6) %>% 
        as.data.frame()

# join genus and species fragments 
join_split_otu.id <- split_otu.id %>% 
        mutate(taxa = str_c(V3, V4, sep = " ")) 

taxa <- join_split_otu.id$taxa 

# merge taxa to raw otu table 
raw_otu_taxa <- cbind(raw_otu, taxa) 


# accumulate counts at the species level 
otu_count_splevel <- raw_otu_taxa %>% 
        gather(key = "sample", value = "count", -c("ID", "X.OTU", "taxa")) %>% 
        group_by(sample, taxa) %>%
        summarise(count_sp = sum(count, na.rm = T)) %>% 
        arrange(desc(count_sp)) %>%
        ungroup()

```

Read in the metadata from URL.

```{r}

# metadata 

meta <- read.csv(file = "https://knights-lab.github.io/MLRepo/datasets/turnbaugh/task-obese-lean-all.txt",
         header = TRUE,
         sep = "") %>% 
        mutate(sample = X.SampleID, is.obese = Var) %>% 
        select(sample, is.obese)

head(meta)

```

The metadata contains `r dim(meta)[1]` samples. `Var` indicates the
independent, binary variable of interest, `Lean` and `Obese`.

Transpose the OTU table into sample x taxa format which is suitable for
proportionality analysis.

```{r transpose OTU table}
otu_count_splevel2 <- otu_count_splevel %>% 
        spread(key = "taxa", value = count_sp) %>%
        column_to_rownames("sample")

```

Now, OTU count table at the species level contains 517 features, in 281
samples.

Filter low abundant taxa before the proportionality analysis. Keep only
the taxa with at least 10 counts in at least 5 samples.

```{r filter low abundant taxa}

keep_index <- apply(otu_count_splevel2, 2, function(x) sum(x >= 10) >= 5)  


```

The resulting OTU table after filtering the low abundant taxa contains
154 unique species/taxa.

Add group variables to the resulting OTU table.

```{r group variables}

otu_count_splevel2_meta <- otu_count_splevel2 %>%
        rownames_to_column("sample") %>%
        inner_join(meta, by= "sample") %>%
        column_to_rownames("sample") 

head(otu_count_splevel2_meta)

```

Check if any missing values in the OTU table. Replace missing values
with zero if any.

```{r handle NA}

sum(is.na(otu_count_splevel2)) 

# otu_count_splevel2_rmna <- otu_count_splevel2 %>%
#         replace(is.na(.), 0)
# 
# sum(is.na(otu_count_splevel2_rmna))

```

### Step 2. Calculate proportionality using propr R package

Calculate a proportionality measurement, `rho` using `propr` function,
following the procedures and codes provided by T.P.Quinn et al.
[@quinn2019]

Set three required arguments in the wrapper `propr` function as follows,

-   `counts` a count matrix with subjects as rows and features as
    columns

-   `metric` the proportionality metric to calculate, 'rho', 'pho' or
    'phs'

-   `ivar` reference OTU/ feature

```{r proportionality}

pr <- propr(counts = otu_count_splevel2, # a count matrix with subjects as rows and features as columns
            metric = "rho", # the proportionality metric to caculate, 'rho', 'pho' or 'phs'
            ivar = "clr", # reference OTU/ feature for alr
            symmetrize = FALSE,
            p = 100) # permutation cycles (100, by default)  
            # select = keep_index) # filter low-abundant taxa


## alternatively, calculate phi, rho or phs using phit(), perb() and phis(), respectively. 
# phi <- phit(raw_otu_t_na, symmetrize = TRUE) 
# 
rho <- perb(otu_count_splevel2, ivar =  "clr", select= keep_index)
# 
# phs <- phis(raw_otu_t_na, ivar = 0) 

```

For proportionality, permute false discovery rate (FDR) for a given
cut-off, instead of estimating parametric P-value.

```{r permutate FDR}

# select a good cutoff for 'rho' by permuting the FDR at various cutoffs.
# below, use [0, .05, ..., .95, 1]

# pr <- updateCutoffs(pr, cutoff = seq(0,1,.05)) 
# 
# pr@fdr


```

According to the package
[vignette](https://rdrr.io/cran/propr/f/vignettes/a_introduction.Rmd),
choose the largest cutoff that keeps the FDR below 0.05. In this case,
`rho` cutoff is 0.20.

Visualize proportionality with a strict cutoff, using `getNetwork`
function. The package
[vignette](https://rdrr.io/cran/propr/f/vignettes/b_visualization.Rmd)
describes several built-in tools for visualizing proportionality.

```{r proportionality-based network}

getNetwork(pr, cutoff = 0.9) 

```

Export highly-proportional (rho \>= 0.9) features (OTU).

```{r highly proportional pairs}

result_rho_df <- getResults(pr, cutoff = 0.9) 

result_rho_df 


```

How to interpret proportionality? Proportionality depends on
log-transformation and must get interpreted with respect to the chosen
reference.

Interpret clr-based proportionality to signify a coordination that
follows the general trend of the data. In other words, these
proportional OTUs move together as individuals relative to how most
genes move on average [@quinn2019].

## Differential proportionality analysis

`propd` functions in the `propr` package can test whether
proportionality of certain pairs change between binary experimental
groups.

The package
[vignette](https://cran.microsoft.com/snapshot/2018-04-24/web/packages/propr/vignettes/e_differential.html)
explains mathematically the differential proportionality measures.

According to the package
[vignette](https://cran.microsoft.com/snapshot/2018-04-24/web/packages/propr/vignettes/e_differential.html),
`propd` method compares the variance of log-ratio (VLR) for one pair
across groups, considering two types of differential proportionality,

-   `disjointed proportionality`: proportionality of a pair holds in
    both groups, but the ratio between the partners changes between the
    groups (i.e., the slope of the proportionality changes)

-   `emergent proportionality`: proportionality exits in only one of the
    groups (i.e., the strength of the proportionality changes)

`propd` function estimates differential proportionality by calculating
$theta$ for all features pairs.

The function takes the following arguments as input:

-   `counts` a matrix of $n$ samples (as rows) and $d$ features (as
    columns)

-   `group` an $n$-dimensional vector corresponding to subject labels

-   `alpha` an optional argument to trigger and guide transformation

-   `p` the total number of permutations used to estimate FDR

```{r differential-proportionality-estimation}

counts <- otu_count_splevel2_meta %>% select(-is.obese) # count matrix, sample X taxa 

group <- otu_count_splevel2_meta$is.obese # binary classes, obese vs lean 

pd <- propd(counts, group, alpha = NA, p=100) # calculate disjointed- and emergent propr. 

```

According the package vignette, the propd object contains theta_d and theta_e (among others), although only theta_d is active by default. Users can easily change which theta is active the functions `setDisjointed` and `setEmergent`.   

```{r disjointed-and-emergent-differential-propr, collapse=TRUE}
 
theta_d <- setDisjointed(pd)  # activate only disjointed diff prop 

theta_e <- setEmergent(pd)  # activate only emergent diff prop 

```
Extract the detailed results from the above objects, including OTU pairs
and differential proportionality statistics.

How to identify most important pairs based on the theta_d and theta_e? Qualitatively, the smaller the theta_d, the more important the proportional pairs are. In contrast, the bigger the theta_e, the more important the proportional pairs are. 

```{r estimate-FDR-disjointed-propr}

# estimate FDR using updateCutoffs function
theta_d <- updateCutoffs(theta_d, cutoff = seq(0.91, 1, 0.001)) 

theta_d@fdr  
```

```{r disjointed-diff-propr-output}

# disjointed diff. proportionality 
theta_d_df <- getResults(theta_d) 


```
The column `theta` equals theta_d matrices. Values of `theta` are 0.91 or greater which are relatively large, indicating that almost all proportional pairs do not obviously change with experimental conditions (i.e., obese or not). In addition, FDR of all the proportional pairs are greater than 5%. 


Similarly, estimate FDR for the emergent differential proportionality. 

```{r estimate-FDR-emergent-diff, results='hide'}

theta_e <- updateCutoffs(theta_e)

```


```{r emergent-diff-propr-output}

# emergent diff. proportionality 
theta_e_df <- getResults(theta_e)  

```

```{r disjointed-prop-based-scatter-plot, fig.height=6, fig.width=8, include=FALSE}

plot(theta_d@counts[, "Odoribacter splanchnicus"],
     theta_d@counts[, "Bacteroides massiliensis"],
     col = ifelse(theta_d@group == "Obese", "red", "blue"))
grp1 <- theta_d@group == "Obese"
grp2 <- theta_d@group != "Obese"
abline(a = 0,
       b = theta_d@counts[grp1, "Odoribacter splanchnicus"] / theta_d@counts[grp1, "Bacteroides massiliensis"],
       col = "red")
abline(a = 0,
       b = theta_d@counts[grp2, "Odoribacter splanchnicus"] / theta_d@counts[grp2, "Bacteroides massiliensis"],
       col = "blue")


```

```{r scatter-plot-ratio-abundance, fig.height=6, fig.width=8, include=FALSE}

plot(theta_d@counts[, "Odoribacter splanchnicus"] / theta_d@counts[, "Bacteroides massiliensis"],
     col = ifelse(theta_d@group == "Obese", "red", "blue"))

```


### Disproportionality networks

Visualize the network based on disjointed differential proportionality using `plot` function. 

Providing a value of [0,1] to the cutoff argument will index pairs based on a maximum value of theta. Alternately, providing an integer greater than 1 to the cutoff argument will index the top N pairs as ranked by theta. 

Note that setting `d3 = TRUE` will have the `rgl` package render the network in 3D. 

```{r disjointed-prop-network, fig.height=6, fig.width=8}

net_d <- plot(theta_d, # disjointed proportionality object 
              cutoff= 300,  
              d3= F)  # whether or not display 3-D plot 

```

Each "node" represents a species/taxa while each connecting "edge" represents an indexed pair (i.e. theta < cutoff). 

For disjointed proportionality networks, red edges show an increase in log-ratio means in Obese compared to Lean while blue edges show a decrease in log-ratio means in Lean. 

Importantly, a small number of taxa/ species participants in a large number of the top differentially proportional pairs. 

```{r taxa-in-disjointed-propr, include=FALSE}

net_d

```


Visualize the network based on emergent differential proportionality using `plot` function. 

```{r emergent-prop-network, fig.height=6, fig.width=8}

net_e <- plot(theta_e, # emergent proportionality object 
              cutoff=800, 
              d3=F)  # whether or not display 3-D plot   

```

For the emergent network, red edges represent an emergency of proportionality in Group 1 compared to Group 2 (i.e., sudden coordination in ...) while blue edges represent a lack of proportionality in Group 1 compared to Group 2 (i.e., no coordination in ...). Visually, the architecture of this network is more sparse than the other. 

According to the packge [vignette](https://cran.microsoft.com/snapshot/2018-04-24/web/packages/propr/vignettes/e_differential.html), note that at the appropriate cutoff, a network will contain all pairs for a given FDR. However, we have routinely found that too many pairs remain when using cutoffs with an acceptable FDR. In this case, we recommend stepping through a number of arbitrarily low cutoffs to find one that produces a representative topology that is computationally tractable and human-interpretable.
