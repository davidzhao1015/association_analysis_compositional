# Association analysis of compositinal microbiome data using R packages

In the repository, four alternative statistical approaches of association analysis were compared, using a compositional microbiome data set. 

According to a highly-cited article "Microbiome Datasets Are Compositional: And This Is Not Optional", SparCC, Spiec Easi,  ϕ and ρ are four alternative validate statistical methods for association analysis of compositional data including microbiome relative data. The four methods are parallelly implemented on a published microbiome data set derived from the HMP-IBD project using R packages.
